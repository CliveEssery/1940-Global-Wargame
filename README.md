# 1940 Global Wargame
 1940 Global Wargame, Rules and Software

There are various README.RST files in most if not all of the directories.

All of the files in the Rules directory are Copyright Clive G Essery until his date of death and thereafter the 
copyright becomes that of the Naval Wargames Society (navalwargamessociety.org).  Those files may however be 
used by anyone wanting to play the game or assist in creating a Python/Tkinter version of the game while I am 
still alive.

All other files are open source and may be used by anyone.

I would welcome assistence in writing the Python/Tkinter version of the game, for which I have made a start and would 
also welcome any testing assistence that anyone cares to make.

I apologise that the code is not very good, I am still learning those two languages though I have written millions of
Source Lines of Code since 1968 in hundreds of languages on dozens of different computers, from binary machine code up
to Multi-threaded Non-stop and Object Orientated languages.

The programmes are laid out in a MVC methodology as recommended by Alan D Moore in his excellent book "Python Gui 
Programming with Tkinter".  

There is plenty of data already available as examples in JSON files so the software
that has been written can be run though with some minor bugs.  More software will be added when I get the time.
I have attempted to keep the User Manual up to date with the coding but there is currently no software documentation
though the JSON file formats have been described. I am one who believes in documentation so hope to add this at some
stage, all things being equal.
