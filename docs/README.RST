==============================
Files in this (Docs) directory
==============================

The files in this dictionary fall into three categories:

1	My original attempt to write code for these rules, written in Delphi Pascal.
	I can no longer afford a Delphi licence and my old one won't run on Windows 10.
	Hence I decided to re-write the code for Python/Tkinter.
	Files included to show my train of thought.

2	Files written before I started coding in Python/Tkinter showing what I thought
	I might create

3	Files written since producing some (part working) Python/Tkinter programmes.
	These should be more realistic and accurate, but they may show asperations 
	(that have yet to be coded) and may not fully represent the current state of
	what is coded.
